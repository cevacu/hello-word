As the company size increases, the percentage of women with high income tend to equalize that of men. However, at the same time, as the company
size increase, women concentrate more in the low-income positions. This contradiction shows that most vulnerable population for working in big 
corporations are those women who may not have high education or advance skills and are looking for operational positions. Government should
try to protect this population.
