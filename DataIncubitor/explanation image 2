As males focus on high income positions, which are those related to executive officers, 
women suffer more gap in their incomes. In contrast, when women manage the company, 
there a fairer income distribution between gender. Similarly, when men are concentrated in low income positions, 
the gap among gender income is lower. All trends show that although governments have made efforts to reduce gender income gap, 
it is still a big problem. Male executives are likely to pay less to women,
keeping the income inequality that society has suffered  by years.
